🧮 Advance Calculator in Python 🎉
Welcome to the Advance Calculator project — a user-friendly, command-line calculator built with Python! This project is perfect for beginners who want to practice object-oriented programming, error handling, and basic math operations in a fun and interactive way. 🚀

✨ Features & Functionalities
This calculator offers:

➕ Addition: Sum two numbers effortlessly.

➖ Subtraction: Find the difference between numbers.

✖️ Multiplication: Multiply numbers accurately.

➗ Division: Divide numbers with error handling for division by zero ❌.

🔢 Power: Calculate exponents using Python's math.pow().

🔍 Square Root: Compute the square roots of numbers individually.

🧹 Clear Screen: Clean your command line interface (Windows support with 'cls').

🛠️ Design & Implementation
Built with an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach via a Calc class that encapsulates all operations.

Each operation is a separate method — keeping the code clean and maintainable.

User-friendly CLI menu guides the user through selecting operations.

Robust input validation ensures smooth user experience without crashes.

Handles exceptions gracefully (like division by zero and invalid inputs).

🚀 Potential Improvements
Add advanced math functions (logarithms, trigonometry, etc.) 📈.

Create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for better interaction 🎨.

Enable multi-step calculations without restarting 🔄.

Add unit tests for reliable and bug-free code ✅.

Improve cross-platform compatibility for screen clearing 🌐.

🎯 Usage Instructions
Run the Python script from your terminal or command prompt:

python calculator.py

Follow the on-screen prompts to choose an operation and input numbers. Results are displayed immediately, and you can continue calculating until you choose to exit.

💡 Conclusion
This project is a fantastic learning tool for mastering Python basics, including classes, methods, exception handling, and CLI development. Feel free to fork, modify, and expand it to suit your needs!

Happy coding! 👩‍💻👨‍💻
